Hi, everyone. I created this project from the tutorial. This tutorial was made in class type, so I changed it to functional type. Belove I will try to describe the differences between the original and mine.

1) I don't use addTotals, but I use useEffect with a dependency, so if you have any changes in useState 'cart', it will change subTotal, Tax, and Total. 

2) I created useState "resetProducts" with dependency "resetProducts" in another useEffect, so if you have any changes in resetProducts, it will reset Products to original data frome storeProducts. You can find it, that I`m using resetProducts in "clearCart". Actually, I guess you can use something more similar like in the video with useCallback,
but I have some problems. For Example, if in the first attempt you chose google pixel, it will be always inCart after clear cart, but in the next attempt It will clear everything in a cart for except "Google pixel phone".

3) I used hook useHistory inside Paypal Button.

4) You don`t need to use "Context.Consumer". In functionals I used useContext and this made it easier to use context. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
